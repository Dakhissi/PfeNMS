' Notes
note right of UC33
  SNMP traps are received
  asynchronously from devices
  when events occur
end note

note bottom of UC16
  Polling occurs at regular
  intervals (default: 30 seconds)
  for all enabled devices
end note

note left of UC27
  Alerts are generated based on
  device status changes, threshold
  violations, or trap events
end note
